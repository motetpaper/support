# Summary

This is an experimental feature based on Apple's StandBy mode.

# Introduction

STAND ASIDE mode is a [CLOCK](https://motetpaper.github.io/clock/) setting that try to imitate the look and feel of [Apple's StandBy mode](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-standby-iph878d77632/ios). 

# More Information

To enable the feature in CLOCK:
  1. Go to the Settings menu.
  2. Click "Turn on STAND ASIDE mode"
  3. Plug in your laptop charger and wait a few seconds. The clock display will change.

STAND ASIDE mode only works on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. 

It is not availble for Firefox or Safari yet.

This feature was introduced in CLOCK Version 2.1.

At this point, only the clock display dims, but more features are in development.
